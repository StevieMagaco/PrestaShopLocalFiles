Installing PrestaShop on your computer
You may wish to install PrestaShop on your local machine, either in order to test it before investing money in a server and domain name, or to customize your store locally before you push your modifications to the PrestaShop installation that you may already have online.

Installing any web application locally requires that you first install the adequate environment, namely the Apache web server, the PHP language interpreter, the MySQL database server, and ideally the phpMyAdmin tool. This is known as an AMP: Apache+MySQL+PHP. It exists for many operating systems, which provides another letter for the acronym: WAMP (Windows+Apache+MySQL+PHP), MAMP (Mac OS X+...) and LAMP (Linux+...).

Choosing an AMP package
This would require you to be quite technical; luckily there exist many pre-built packages that you can install easily. It does not prevent you from having to get technical here and there, but they do provide a huge help. Since all of the items packaged are open-source, these installers are most of the time free. Here is a selection of free AMP installers:
EasyPHP: http://www.easyphp.org/ (Windows)
MAMP: http://www.mamp.info/ (Mac OS X)
WampServer: http://www.wampserver.com/en/ (Windows)
XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris)

EasyPHP has a special all-in-one package, which includes a ready-to-use installation of PrestaShop 1.6! It is the easiest way to discover the new version of PrestaShop and, for developers, to develop themes and modules.

Choose the package that you feel the most comfortable with, and launch it.
